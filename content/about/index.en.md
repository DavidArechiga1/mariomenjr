{{< figure src="about.jpg" title="Mario Menjivar" caption="At the Grand Canyon. January 2023.">}}

My name is **Mario Menjívar** (b. 1993), and I am a curiosity-driven human, computer scientist, and immigrant. I am originally from El Salvador where I lived two-thirds of my life, I currently reside in Southern California.

I work building software to automate and streamline industrial processes, generally in C# and JavaScript. I also dedicate much time to reading history, watching documentaries, and walking. I am learning French.

In terms of education, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from **Western Governors University**. My first exposure to this science happened in my country at **Instituto Técnico Ricaldone**.

Most of the content you'll find on this page is the direct result of my learning journey, I generally write it for myself. I thought it was a good idea to make it available to the public in case it helps.

Any comment is welcome, you have my contact information at the bottom of this page.
