{{< figure src="/about.jpg" title="Mario Menjivar" caption="De visita al Gran Cañón. Enero, 2023.">}}

My name is **Mario Menjívar** (n. 1993), and I am a curiosity-driven human, computer scientist, and immigrant. I am originally from El Salvador where I lived two thirds of my life, I currently reside in Southern California. I am learning French.

I work building software to automate and streamline industrial processes, generally in C# and JavaScript. I also dedicate a good amount of time to read history, watch documentaries, and walk.

In terms of education, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from **Western Governors University**. My first exposure to these science happened back in my country at the **Instituto Técnico Ricaldone**.

Most of the content you'll find in this page is the direct result of my learning journey, I generally write it for myself. I thought it was a good idea to make it available to the public in case it helps.

Any comment is welcome, you have my contact information at the bottom of this page.
